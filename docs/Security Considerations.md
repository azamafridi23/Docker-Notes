1. **Container Isolation:** While Docker containers provide some level of isolation, they are not completely secure by default. It's important to follow security best practices such as running containers with minimal privileges and limiting their access to host resources.
    
2. **Image Security:** Docker images should be scanned for vulnerabilities before being deployed to production environments. Tools such as Docker Security Scanning can help identify security issues in Docker images.
    
3. **Network Security:** Docker containers should be isolated from each other and from the host system using network security measures such as firewalls and network policies.
