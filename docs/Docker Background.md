- The Docker client, often simply referred to as `docker`, is the primary interface through which users interact with the Docker Engine. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to manage Docker containers, images, volumes, networks, and other Docker objects.
- The Docker host is the physical or virtual machine where the Docker Engine runs. It's responsible for managing and running Docker containers.
- The Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. It's where Docker users can store and share Docker images with others.
