1. **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to use a YAML file to configure the services that make up your application and run them with a single command.
    
2. **Docker Swarm:** Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker. It allows you to create and manage a cluster of Docker hosts, making it easy to deploy and scale applications across multiple hosts.
    
3. **Docker Networking:** Docker provides networking features that allow containers to communicate with each other and with other services outside the container.
    
4. **Docker Volumes:** Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes allow you to share data between containers and persist data even if the container is stopped or deleted.
