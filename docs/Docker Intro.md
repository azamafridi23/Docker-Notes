Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development, which includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, etc. This ensures that the application runs seamlessly across different computing environments, from development to testing to production.
