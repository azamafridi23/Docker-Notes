1. **Write a Dockerfile:** Create a Dockerfile that defines the steps to build your Docker image. This includes specifying a base image, adding dependencies, and setting up the environment.
    
2. **Build an Image:** Use the `docker build` command to build your Docker image based on the Dockerfile you created.
    
3. **Run a Container:** Once you have a Docker image, you can create and run Docker containers based on that image using the `docker run` command.
    
4. **Manage Containers:** You can manage your Docker containers using various commands such as `docker ps` to list running containers, `docker stop` to stop a container, and `docker rm` to remove a container.
    
5. **Push and Pull Images:** If you want to share your Docker image with others, you can push it to a registry using the `docker push` command. Similarly, you can pull Docker images from a registry using the `docker pull` command.
