Docker volumes are a mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. They provide a way to store and share data between containers and persist data even if the container is stopped or deleted. Volumes are particularly useful for scenarios where you need to store data that should persist beyond the lifecycle of a single container, such as database storage, file uploads, or log files.
